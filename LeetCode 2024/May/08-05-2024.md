## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `score` of size `n`, where `score[i]` is the score of the `i`th athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be unique.

The athletes are placed based on their scores, where the 1st place athlete has the highest score, the 2nd place athlete has the 2nd highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:

- The 1st place athlete's rank is "Gold Medal".
- The 2nd place athlete's rank is "Silver Medal".
- The 3rd place athlete's rank is "Bronze Medal".
- For the 4th place to the `n`th place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the `x`th place athlete's rank is "`x`").

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the rank of the `i`th athlete.

## Example

Input: score = [10, 3, 8, 9, 4]
Output: ["Gold Medal", "5", "Bronze Medal", "Silver Medal", "4"]
Explanation: The placements are [1st, 5th, 3rd, 2nd, 4th].

## Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a priority queue to sort the athletes based on their scores. We will store both the score and the index of the athlete in the priority queue. Then, we will iterate over the priority queue to assign ranks to each athlete based on their position in the sorted order.

Here's how the approach works:

1. We create a priority queue (`pq`) of pairs, where the first element of the pair is the score of the athlete and the second element is the index of the athlete.
2. We iterate over the scores and insert each score-index pair into the priority queue.
3. We initialize a rank variable to keep track of the current rank and set it to 1.
4. We iterate over the priority queue until it's empty:
   - Pop the top element from the priority queue.
   - Assign the appropriate rank to the athlete based on their position in the sorted order:
     - If the rank is 1, assign "Gold Medal".
     - If the rank is 2, assign "Silver Medal".
     - If the rank is 3, assign "Bronze Medal".
     - Otherwise, assign the rank as a string.
   - Increment the rank.
5. Return the array containing the ranks of the athletes.

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(n log n), where n is the number of athletes.
- Space Complexity: O(n).

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findRelativeRanks(vector<int>& score) {
        int n = score.size();
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq; 

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            pq.emplace(score[i], i);
        }

        vector<string> res(n);

        int rank = 1;
        while (!pq.empty()) {
            auto current = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            int index = current.second;
            if (rank == 1) {
                res[index] = "Gold Medal";
            } else if (rank == 2) {
                res[index] = "Silver Medal";
            } else if (rank == 3) {
                res[index] = "Bronze Medal";
            } else {
                res[index] = to_string(rank);
            }
            ++rank;
        }

        return res;
    }
};
