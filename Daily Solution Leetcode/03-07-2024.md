## Editorial

The problem is to determine the minimum possible difference between the largest and smallest values in an array after making at most three moves, where a move consists of removing one element from the array.

### Approach

This problem can be efficiently solved by leveraging sorting and then considering specific possible moves. The key insight is that after sorting the array, the smallest and largest values to be considered for the difference are always at the extremes of the sorted array. By removing up to three of the smallest or largest elements, we can achieve the desired result.

#### Key Steps:

1. **Sorting the Array**:
    - First, sort the array to simplify the process of finding the smallest and largest elements.

2. **Handling Small Arrays**:
    - If the array has 4 or fewer elements, the result is 0 because we can remove all elements.

3. **Calculating Possible Differences**:
    - Compute the differences considering up to three moves, i.e., removing up to three of the smallest or largest elements.
    - Specifically, consider these scenarios:
      - Remove the three smallest elements.
      - Remove the two smallest elements and one largest element.
      - Remove the one smallest element and two largest elements.
      - Remove the three largest elements.
    - Calculate the difference for each of these scenarios and return the minimum difference.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDifference(vector<int>& nums) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n <= 4) return 0;

        int a = nums[n-1] - nums[3];
        int b = nums[n-2] - nums[2];
        int c = nums[n-3] - nums[1];
        int d = nums[n-4] - nums[0];

        return min({a, b, c, d});
    }
};
```
### Explanation of Code

**Sorting the Array**:

- The array is sorted using `sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());`, which has a time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \).

**Handling Small Arrays**:

- If the size of the array `n` is 4 or fewer, return 0 because all elements can be removed.

**Calculating Differences**:

- Calculate the differences after removing up to three smallest or largest elements:
  - `a = nums[n-1] - nums[3]`: Removing the first three smallest elements.
  - `b = nums[n-2] - nums[2]`: Removing the first two smallest and the last largest element.
  - `c = nums[n-3] - nums[1]`: Removing the first smallest and the last two largest elements.
  - `d = nums[n-4] - nums[0]`: Removing the last three largest elements.
- Return the minimum of these four values using `return min({a, b, c, d});`.

### Efficiency

The sorting operation dominates the time complexity, resulting in \( O(n \log n) \). The space complexity is \( O(1) \) as only a few extra variables are used.
