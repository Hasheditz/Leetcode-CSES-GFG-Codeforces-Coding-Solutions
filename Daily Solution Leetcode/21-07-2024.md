## Editorial

The problem requires constructing a k x k matrix using the given row and column conditions. The matrix should be built such that the numbers 1 to k are placed in the matrix, satisfying the given conditions for row and column precedence.

### Approach

This problem can be efficiently solved by leveraging graph theory and topological sorting. The key steps involve creating graphs for row and column conditions, performing topological sorts on these graphs, and then using the sorted order to place the numbers in the matrix.

#### Key Steps:

1. **Graph Construction**:
    - Construct directed graphs for both row and column conditions.

2. **Topological Sorting**:
    - Perform topological sorting on the constructed graphs to determine the order of numbers for rows and columns.

3. **Matrix Construction**:
    - Use the topologically sorted order to position the numbers in the matrix.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Graph Construction**:
    - For row conditions, create a graph where each edge from node `a` to node `b` signifies that `a` must come before `b` in the row.
    - Similarly, create a graph for column conditions.

2. **Topological Sorting**:
    - Implement a function `topo_sort` using Depth-First Search (DFS) to perform the topological sort. This function returns the topologically sorted order of nodes.
    - If there is a cycle detected during DFS, return an empty result indicating that it is not possible to satisfy the conditions.

3. **Matrix Construction**:
    - Use the sorted orders from the topological sorts to determine the row and column indices for each number.
    - Place each number in the matrix at the position determined by its row and column indices.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> buildMatrix(int k, vector<vector<int>>& rowConditions, vector<vector<int>>& colConditions) {
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> graph;
        for (const auto& edge : rowConditions) {
            graph[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        }

        vector<int> row_sorting = topo_sort(graph, k);
        graph.clear();
        for (const auto& edge : colConditions) {
            graph[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
        }
        vector<int> col_sorting = topo_sort(graph, k);

        if (row_sorting.empty() || col_sorting.empty()) {
            return {};
        }

        unordered_map<int, pair<int, int>> value_position;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            value_position[row_sorting[i]].first = i;
            value_position[col_sorting[i]].second = i;
        }

        vector<vector<int>> res(k, vector<int>(k, 0));
        for (int value = 1; value <= k; ++value) {
            int row = value_position[value].first;
            int column = value_position[value].second;
            res[row][column] = value;
        }

        return res;
    }

private:
    bool dfs(int src, unordered_map<int, vector<int>>& graph, unordered_set<int>& visited, unordered_set<int>& cur_path, vector<int>& res) {
        if (cur_path.count(src)) return false; 
        if (visited.count(src)) return true;  

        visited.insert(src);
        cur_path.insert(src);

        for (int neighbor : graph[src]) {
            if (!dfs(neighbor, graph, visited, cur_path, res))  
                return false;
        }

        cur_path.erase(src);  
        res.push_back(src);
        return true;
    }

    vector<int> topo_sort(unordered_map<int, vector<int>>& graph, int k) {
        unordered_set<int> visited;
        unordered_set<int> cur_path;
        vector<int> res;

        for (int src = 1; int src <= k; ++src) {
            if (!dfs(src, graph, visited, cur_path, res))
                return {};
        }

        reverse(res.begin(), res.end());  
        return res;
    }
};
```
### Explanation of Code

**Graph Construction**:

- Construct graphs for row and column conditions using adjacency lists.

**Topological Sorting**:

- Implement `topo_sort` using DFS, which includes cycle detection.
- `dfs` function visits nodes and adds them to the result in post-order.

**Matrix Construction**:

- Use the positions from topological sorts to place values in the matrix.
- Iterate through values 1 to k, placing each value at its corresponding position.

### Efficiency

The overall time complexity is \( O(k^2) \), dominated by the graph construction and topological sorting steps. The space complexity is \( O(k^2) \), used for storing the graphs and the resulting matrix.
