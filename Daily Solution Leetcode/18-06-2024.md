## Editorial

Given the difficulty of tasks and the corresponding profits, along with the abilities of workers, the task is to assign workers to tasks in a way that maximizes the total profit.

### Approach

We can solve this problem using a brute-force approach by iterating through each worker and finding the most profitable task they can perform.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Calculate the number of workers (`n`) and the number of tasks (`m`).
2. **Iterate Through Workers**: For each worker, check each task they can perform based on their ability.
3. **Update Profit**: Keep track of the maximum profit a worker can achieve and add it to the total profit.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfitAssignment(vector<int>& diff, vector<int>& profit, vector<int>& worker) {
        int n = worker.size();
        int m = profit.size();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int curr = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (worker[i] >= diff[j]) curr = max(curr, profit[j]);
            }
            ans += curr;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Code

#### Initialization:

- Calculate the number of workers `n` and the number of tasks `m`.
- Initialize `ans` to store the total profit.

#### Iteration:

1. Loop through each worker.
   - For each worker, initialize `curr` to 0.
   - Loop through each task to check if the worker can perform the task (i.e., their ability is greater than or equal to the difficulty of the task).
     - If the worker can perform the task, update `curr` to be the maximum of `curr` and the profit of the task.
   - Add the maximum profit the worker can achieve (`curr`) to the total profit (`ans`).

#### Return Value:

- After processing all workers, return the total profit (`ans`).

#### Efficiency:

- This approach has a time complexity of \( O(n \times m) \), which might not be optimal for large inputs but provides a clear and straightforward solution to the problem.
