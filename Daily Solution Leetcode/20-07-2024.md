## Editorial

The problem is to construct a matrix given the sums of each row and each column. The task is to create an `n x m` matrix such that the sum of elements in the `i-th` row is equal to `row[i]` and the sum of elements in the `j-th` column is equal to `col[j]`.

### Approach

This problem can be efficiently solved using a greedy algorithm. The key insight is to iteratively fill the matrix by choosing the minimum value between the current row sum and the current column sum, then updating the sums accordingly.

#### Key Steps:

1. **Initialize the Matrix**:
    - Create an `n x m` matrix filled with zeros.

2. **Greedy Filling**:
    - Iterate through each cell of the matrix.
    - For each cell, set the value to the minimum of the current row sum and column sum.
    - Subtract this value from the current row sum and column sum.
    - Move to the next cell.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> restoreMatrix(vector<int>& row, vector<int>& col) {
        int n = row.size();
        int m = col.size();
        vector<vector<int>> res(n, vector<int>(m));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j) {
                res[i][j] = min(row[i], col[j]);
                row[i] -= res[i][j];
                col[j] -= res[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```
### Explanation of Code

**Initialize the Matrix**:

An `n x m` matrix is created using `vector<vector<int>> res(n, vector<int>(m));`.

**Greedy Filling**:

- Iterate over each row `for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)` and within each row, iterate over each column `for (int j = 0; j < m; ++j)`.
- Set `res[i][j]` to the minimum of `row[i]` and `col[j]` using `res[i][j] = min(row[i], col[j]);`.
- Update `row[i]` and `col[j]` by subtracting `res[i][j]` from them (`row[i] -= res[i][j];` and `col[j] -= res[i][j];`).

### Efficiency

The algorithm runs in ( O(n \* m) ) time complexity, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns. This is because we iterate through each cell of the matrix exactly once. The space complexity is ( O(n * m) ) for storing the result matrix.
