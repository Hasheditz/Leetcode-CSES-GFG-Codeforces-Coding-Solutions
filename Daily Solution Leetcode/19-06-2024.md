## Editorial

The problem is to determine the minimum number of days required to make \( m \) bouquets from an array of days, where each bouquet consists of \( k \) consecutive flowers. If it's not possible to make \( m \) bouquets, return -1.

### Approach

This problem can be efficiently solved using a binary search on the number of days. The idea is to find the minimum day such that we can make \( m \) bouquets using the given flowers blooming days.

#### Key Steps:

1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
    - Set `low` to the minimum day in the array.
    - Set `high` to the maximum day in the array.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
    - Calculate `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`.
    - Use a helper function `sets` to count the number of bouquets that can be made if the flowers bloom by day `mid`.
    - If the number of bouquets is greater than or equal to \( m \), update the result and adjust the search to find a potentially smaller day by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.
    - If the number of bouquets is less than \( m \), adjust the search to find a larger day by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.

3. **Helper Function `sets`**:
    - This function counts the number of bouquets that can be made by day `mid`.
    - It iterates through the array and counts the number of consecutive flowers that bloom by `mid`.
    - When a non-blooming flower is encountered, it calculates the number of bouquets from the consecutive blooming flowers and resets the counter.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
    int sets(vector<int> &day, int k, int mid) {
        int curr = 0, n = day.size(), cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (day[i] <= mid) curr++;
            else {cnt += curr / k; curr = 0;}
        }
        cnt += curr / k;
        return cnt;
    }

public:
    int minDays(vector<int>& day, int m, int k) {
        int n = day.size();
        if (n < 1LL * m * k) return -1;

        int low = *min_element(day.begin(), day.end());
        int high = *max_element(day.begin(), day.end());
        int res = INT_MAX;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            int curr = sets(day, k, mid);

            if (curr >= m) {
                res = min(res, mid);
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
### Explanation of Code

**Helper Function `sets`**:

- It initializes `curr` to count consecutive blooming flowers and `cnt` to count bouquets.
- Iterates through the `day` array and increments `curr` if the flower blooms by `mid`.
- If a flower does not bloom by `mid`, it calculates the number of bouquets from `curr` and resets `curr`.

**Main Function `minDays`**:

- Checks if the total number of flowers is less than ( m times k ). If true, returns -1.
- Initializes `low` to the smallest day and `high` to the largest day.
- Uses binary search to find the minimum day where \( m \) bouquets can be made.
- Updates the result and adjusts the search range based on the number of bouquets that can be made by the current `mid` day.

**Efficiency**:

- The binary search approach ensures a time complexity of O(N log (Max-Min)), making it efficient for large inputs.
