## Editorial

Given a non-negative integer \( c \), the task is to determine whether there exist two integers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( a^2 + b^2 = c \). 

### Approach

We can solve this problem efficiently using a two-pointer technique. The idea is to use one pointer starting from 0 (let's call it `low`) and another pointer starting from `(sqrt{c})` (let's call it `high`). We then check the sum of squares of the values at these two pointers.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Set `low` to 0 and `high` to \( \sqrt{c} \).
2. **Iterate and Check**: While `low` is less than or equal to `high`, compute the sum of the squares of `low` and `high`.
    - If the sum is equal to \( c \), return `true`.
    - If the sum is less than \( c \), increment the `low` pointer to increase the sum.
    - If the sum is greater than \( c \), decrement the `high` pointer to decrease the sum.

### Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool judgeSquareSum(int c) {
        int part = 0;
        long long low = 0, high = sqrt(c);

        while (low <= high) {
            long long sumOfSquares = low * low + high * high;
            if (sumOfSquares == c) {
                return true;
            } else if (sumOfSquares > c) {
                high--;
            } else {
                low++;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Code

**Initialization**:

- `low` is initialized to 0.
- `high` is initialized to \( \sqrt{c} \).

**Iteration**:

- The `while` loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- In each iteration, we calculate `sumOfSquares` as \( \text{low}^2 + \text{high}^2 \).
  - If `sumOfSquares` is equal to \( c \), we return `true` indicating that such integers \( a \) and \( b \) exist.
  - If `sumOfSquares` is greater than \( c \), we decrement `high` to reduce the sum.
  - If `sumOfSquares` is less than \( c \), we increment `low` to increase the sum.

**Termination**:

- If the loop exits without finding any such pairs, we return `false`.

**Efficiency**:

- The two-pointer approach iterates at most \( \sqrt{c} \) times, making the time complexity \( O(\sqrt{c}) \). This is an optimal and efficient solution for the problem.
